> Millefy tool by Ozaki et al. 2020 packaged so it works in launches via MyBinder.org!

Worked out what was needed over at my reporconda test using https://github.com/yuifu/millefy/tree/master#installation and realizing needed to unpin r-base (based on https://github.com/ngs-docs/2020-ggg-201b-rnaseq) and that millefy Anaconda recipe existed when searching with term 'anaconda millefy' came up with some text that listed r-millefy & so then I searched Anaconda's tool bar at https://anaconda.org/bioconda/repo for 'r-millefy' , to get https://anaconda.org/search?q=r-millefy that listed https://anaconda.org/search?q=r-millefy !!!
